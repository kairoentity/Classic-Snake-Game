# Classic Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the border and itself. The player controls the snake using standard keys. Upon collision with the border or itself, the game resets, and the snake respawns at a random position. This project utilizes Pygame for rendering graphics and handling events, and Python’s random library to generate random positions for the snake and food. The game also includes a scoring system that tracks how many food items the snake eats, and the score is displayed on the screen. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible before colliding.


## Usage:
Use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the movement of the snake. Press W to move up, A to move left, S to move down, and D to move right. The snake grows longer as it eats food, and the game ends when it collides with the walls or itself. The score is displayed on the screen and increases with each food item eaten.
